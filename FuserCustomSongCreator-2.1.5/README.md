# Fuser Custom Song Creator

[![.github/workflows/build.yml](https://github.com/NarrikSynthfox/FuserCustomSongCreator/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NarrikSynthfox/FuserCustomSongCreator/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Introduction

A small UI to create custom songs for Fuser! Requires [Fuser Song Loader](https://github.com/NarrikSynthfox/FuserSongLoader/) to function.

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elenasayshi/FuserCustomSongCreator.git
cd FuserCustomSongCreator
./build.bat
```
`Fuser_CustomSongCreator.sln` should be generated under the `FuserCustomSongCreator/build` folder.

## Development repo

If you want to look at the changes over time between the old version and this one, [here's the dev repository](https://github.com/NarrikSynthfox/FuserCustomSongCreator-dev). I had to make it a separate repo so it could be made private, then on release I forked and uploaded the updated code as a new commit.
